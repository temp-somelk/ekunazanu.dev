I won't beat around the bush. College feels like a giant waste of time and money, not that I should be surprised. But to be fair I haven't been productive myself either. I just wasted an entire summer. And two years before that. And also two years before that. I've been slacking for way too long and it's time to get serious.

This is the goal: Speedrun the fundamentals of computer science.

First things first, I need a plan. Fortunately, I have one. Unfortunately I don't have enough braincells to pull it off quickly enough. BUT fortunately my braincell count is just right enough that I *think* I can do it — right the top of the Dunning-Kruger curve.

## The Plan™

Okay, so The Plan™ is ridiculously simple: Just study and make projects. To be more specific though, that includes completing most of the first three chapters of [SICP](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf), and getting comfortable with [discrete math](https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/teaching/discrete_math_fall_2005/dmbook.pdf) and [linear algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/). I also want to focus a bit on [DSA](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/373/videos/), and learn some JS and make one or two web related projects. All this hopefully by the end the of this year, 2024. And if I have a healthy amount of time left, practice some [math for CS](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.042/spring17/mcs.pdf).

If all those links seemed familiar, it is because it's from [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/). By the next semester I am hoping to finish [operating systems](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#operating-systems) and [networking](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#networking) and a little bit about [databases](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#databases). I probably don't *need* to learn about compilers too, so it's pretty far down the list of things I need to get done immediately — but it's a nice topic I definitely I want to learn more about after graduation.

And now, the most important part of The Plan™ — I know my ADHD brain will try its best to get distracted by the most random of things, so the aim here is to post a log every week about the things I learnt to keep me in check. Similar to how tracking expenses make people more deliberate about their spending, hopefully writing these logs will knock some sense into me and make me aware of how much time I waste every week. These will be short summaries; my acutal notes will still be on a private Obsidian repo. Maybe I'll make it public. No guarantees.

That's all. See you until next week — if this site still exists by then. If it does, I don't intend on wasting more than ten minutes writing these, so if anyone is reading this, don't expect high quality posts.

**TL;DR**: It's time to start being productive. And hopefully to find gold. Or a job.
