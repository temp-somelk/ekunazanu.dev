Paragraph with an [internal link](linkaddress) and [external link](https://google.com).

Huge fan of pastelle photos of [echevarrio.io](https://www.echevarria.io/).

But also for doodles, maybe a style similar to [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) and this:

### Header3

Another paragraph with *emphasis* or **strong emphasis**. Also `monospaced string or inline code`. Don't use underline, to reduce confusion with links. ~~Strikethrough~~ is fine though. Also <mark>you can mark text</mark>. Not sure how it can be useful.

This is some sample text again. I don't know what to say other than that this is tedious. Okay, maybe not, but at least this is a waste of time. At least on the bright side I get to practice my typing skills and frankly I am not surprised I'm this slow. Worse, I am making too many mistakes. Good thing my typing won't be a bottleneck. My brain will. Anyways I think this is enough text for a paragraph to check how images look between paragraphs.

Some random words. And some other random words, to pad out this paragraph. It's not enough text so adding more here. I guess this is enough. Okay it's not, so here I am adding more. It's repetitive, but it is what is is. Okay maybe this is enough. Yeah it is. And then something here to end the article.
