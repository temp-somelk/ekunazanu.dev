This was a triumph\
I am making a note here:\
"Huge success"\
It's hard to overstate\
My satisfaction

Okay, more like mediocre success. But I'll take it over no progress.

It started out as a journaling device to keep me on track and from wasting time. The goal was for mediocre success. Goal achieved.

Now, these points of data make a beautiful line. And we're out of beta, we're releasing on time.

I am rewarding myself with cake. I hate cakes.
