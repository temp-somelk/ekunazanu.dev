Here's stuff that I probably should mention.

## Attribution

The design of this site is based on [Tom MacWright](https://macwright.com)'s wonderful, minimal site. The main typeface is [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/), and the monospace font is [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/). The serifs are [Playfair Display](https://www.forthehearts.net/playfair2_0/). I wanted to stick with system fonts, but I really like the look of the typefaces.

I try to use my own drawings and media files whenever I can, but if not, it's most likely sourced from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), [pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) or [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/). The entire site is built using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).

### Blogroll

There's a lot of content created by some *very* smart people who put insane levels of dedication to their craft, that I personally love obsessing about. These aren't exactly all blogs per se, but it's damn good content I guarantee. Here's a (truncated) list of the people and/or their amazing creations:

## Legal

Also most jurisdictions require me to have this section — the most boring part on this site, and probably most other sites. Anyway, I tried to look up on what the proper way of constructing all sentences using fancy technical legal jargon, however I still couldn't find anything appropriate, so I'm still not sure of the proper way to this.

Pretty much all of the "This is advice for legal pages but this is not legal advice" pages suggested I should have these three distinct categories, that outlines how I handle user information (if any at all).

### Privacy Policy

There is no analaytics on this website because I'm already very well aware of my target demographic, aka Arhya. The TLDR is I do not collect your personal information; I simply don't care enough about you, sorry. This entire subsection is irrelevant. I cannot speak for GitHub (Pages) though, the platform hosting this site.

### Disclaimer

I am not affiliated with any entity. In fact if my college found out that I write all this trash, I'll probably get rusticated. I also do not take any responsibility for the damage I may or may not have done to your computer. I think it's kind of your fault anyway if you decided to follow the advice of a guy who is writing the legal pages of a blog as a joke.

### Terms of Use

The content on this website is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), unless specified otherwise. The media — the shitty graphics and drawings on this site — are mine and are published under the [same license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), unless specified otherwise. The media on this site that I do not own are subject to their own copyright.

Put another way, you can use the stuff I created anyway you like — just don't sue me. Attribution would be nice, but it's the internet and it's unrealistic to expect anyone to do so, but it's always appreciated.

## Go Away

I'm surprised you clicked on this page in the first place, and decided to continue to read on through the uninteresting legal section. There's a real possibility you might be a nerd, or are insane. Anyway, I don't think there's much more to add that's apt for this page. Even if there is, I've reached the end of my thinking capacity.

![doodle of person shooing off someone away](/media/others/doodle-shoo.avif)

Go on then, go away. Read some [interesting stuff](/lab) instead of this boring text.
