Hi! I am Anchit. I am a third year computer science undergraduate student. I like math, movies, progressive rock, and coding. One of them is a lie.

I also like doodling I guess.

## About

Most smart people I know have their own blogs and I want to *appear* smart too, so here we are. Alright no, my real goal is to be able to become competent enough to write high-quality-production-grade-hyper-fast-efficient-code™ within the next two years. The only hurdle between me and my path to mediocre success is my laziness and stupidity. And a semi-practical to be self aware of my laziness and stupidity, is by trying to keep a [log](/log) of my laziness and stupidity. So here we are.

Just kidding; the *real* real goal was indeed the first one: Trick people into thinking I'm smart.

There's also another section [lab](/lab), where I'll post 'actual' content. It simply means that I'll try to put at least *some* effort towards the content. Maybe. These will mostly be topics that I find interesting — boring things like math and data.

Anyway, here's [more](/more) things about the site if you care to know. Here's the [site feed](/atom.xml).

## Contact

If you want to complain about my lousy writing, point out factual inaccuracies, or send ideas or memes to me, you can reach me at [foo@ekunazanu.dev](mailto:foo@ekunazanu.dev). Will I respond? Good question. I sign my stuff using a [minisign key](/misc/ekunazanu.pub).
