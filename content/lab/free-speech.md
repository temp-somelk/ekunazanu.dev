This is another experimental post. Arguably more 'experimental' than the previous ones.

Use Pi Zero 2W or Pi 3B for the social experiment. Visualise using a word cloud, and bar chart for the same data below (using D3?) Heatmap for most usage using calendar plot â€” but zoomed on for a few months. Link for raw data at the bottom. Pi sends new data every 30 minutes.
