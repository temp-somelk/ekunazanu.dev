<!-- ![fixed spd of magenta above response curve graph with fixed vertical wavelength lines; changing spd — depending on wavelength and intensity slider — above response curve graph with wavelength and intensity slider; two response curve graphs of photoreceptor cells; two FIXED vertical lines overlaid on one response graph to show two wavelengths of blue and red; one set sliders for wavelength & number of photons below the other response curve graph; one vertical line to show changeable wavelength in the above the slider; show amount of response of each type of receptor cells as (unmovable/grayed out) bars on the right (vertical) or below (horizontal); emphasis on response of cones; others are lightened out (maybe low contrast); show interesection of wavelength vertical line indicator and response curve as small (but bigger than lines) dots; emphasis on intersection cones curve (others are grayed/low-contrast out); curve changes as intensity slider changes; another set of (unmovable/grayedout) bars BUT FIXED to show response of cones for magenta (blue and red); show response of magenta as addition of (unmovable/grayedout bars) responses of blue wavelength and response of red wavelength (another unmovable/grayedout) bars) — with sum as magenta response(unmovable/grayedout bars); user tries to move movable wavelength and intensity to change output of grayedoutbars to match FIXED grayedout bars of magenta response;](interactive) -->
