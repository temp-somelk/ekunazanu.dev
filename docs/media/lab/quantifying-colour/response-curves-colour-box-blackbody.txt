<!-- ![spd on top — dependent on slider for temperature; another spd below — zoomed in on range 400nm-700nm — maybe show lines on above spd to indicate it is zoomed in view of the above spd; sensitivity curve graph of photoreceptor cells below; response curve of above two graphs below — shade the areas below with colour of photoreceptor type (rod=black,s=blue,m=greenish,l=yellowish-to-red); slider for temperature at bottom below all graphs; show amount of response of each type of receptors (rods and cones) as a sort of (progress/without sliding knob) bars on the right of the sliders for wavelength and intensity of photons; eg: https://jamie-wong.com/images/color/ConeExcitation1.png — combine all the three coloumns to one graph; keep rows separate; small colour box below or next to right to response (progress-like) bar, showing colors BUT NO colour names below the box; highlight response of cones progress bars and cones curves — by greying/reducing contrast of rods response progress bars, rods sensitivity curves, and rods response curves;](interactive) -->
