<!-- ![xy plane with faint dotted triangle outline — vertices determined by sliders; make line endpoints un-draggable — instead determined by three sliders for wavelengths — vertices would lie on spetral locus; three more sliders determines relative intensity of primaries — increasing intensity of one decreases the other two — such that the ratio between the other two is preserved; stacked horizontal bar chart bar to show ratios of primaries; two solid distinct lines on xy plane and show final point as point on a line — and the line is determined by a point on another line — similar to https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs148-10-summer/docs/2010--kerr--cie_xyz.pdf PAGE 13 — but make the point and lines adjustable using sliders;](interactive) -->
