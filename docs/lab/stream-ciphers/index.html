There are different ways to encrypt data, but most can be classified into two main categories based on the type of keys used.<p>The first kind employs one key to both encrypt and decrypt data, and is called <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm target=_blank>symmetric key cryptography</a> — due to the symmetry of keys involved in the encryption-decryption process. The second type, called <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography target=_blank>asymmetric key cryptography</a>, involves using a key to encrypt the data and a separate key to decrypt the encrypted data.<p>This post is primarily about symmetric key cryptography, and more specifically about stream ciphers.<h2 id=Caesar_Cipher>Caesar Cipher</h2><p>One of the simplest encryption techniques includes the <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher target=_blank>Caesar cipher</a>, a type of <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher#Simple target=_blank>simple substitution cipher</a>. The message to be encrypted (called plaintext) is encoded by substituting its letters with the corresponding letters from an alphabet that is ‘shifted’ or ‘rotated’ to the left or right by some amount:</p><svg viewbox="0 0 200 75" fill=none height=450px id=bitarraySVG width=1200px><desc>Bit array.</desc><rect fill=#aaa height=150 id=bitarrayBG width=200 x=0 y=0 /></svg><p>If the letters are encoded as a number determined by its position in the alphabet, then the encrypted letter for a plaintext letter <code>m</code> is <code>E(m) = (m + k) mod 26</code>, where <code>k</code> is the shift value. The encrypted message is often referred to as the ciphertext. Decryption has to reverse the encryption operation. So the decrypted letter for the ciphertext letter <code>c</code> is then <code>D(c) = (c - k) mod 26</code>.</p><svg viewbox="0 0 200 75" fill=none height=450px id=bitarraySVG width=1200px><desc>Bit array.</desc><rect fill=#aaa height=150 id=bitarrayBG width=200 x=0 y=0 /></svg><details open><summary>Modulo Operation</summary> The <code>mod</code> or <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo target=_blank>modulo operator</a> returns the remainder after division by a number — which in this case is 26, the number of letters in the Latin alphabet.</details><p>The <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13 target=_blank>ROT13</a> is a popular and special case of a Caesar cipher, having a shift value of 13. Since the Latin alphabet has 26 letters, shifting the alphabet to the left by 13 positions is the same as shifting it to the right by 13 positions. So, decryption can be defined as the same operation as encryption. That is, for a plaintext message <code>m</code> with ciphertext <code>c</code>:<p><code>E(m) = (m + 13) mod 26 = (m - 13) mod 26 = c</code><br> <code>D(c) = (c + 13) mod 26 = (c - 13) mod 26 = m</code><p>Both the encryption and decryption operations are the same. The only difference is the domain of the operators — one operates on the plaintext while the other operates on the ciphertext — but that difference is purely semantical.</p><svg viewbox="0 0 200 75" fill=none height=450px id=bitarraySVG width=1200px><desc>Bit array.</desc><rect fill=#aaa height=150 id=bitarrayBG width=200 x=0 y=0 /></svg><p>The shift parameter in the Caesar cipher determines how a message gets encrypted and decrypted — it acts as a ‘key’ for encrypting and decrypting the data. Only parties who have the knowledge about the keys can decrypt the messages encrypted with that key. While this is the main goal of symmetric encryption, the Caesar cipher is not a very good way to achieve this goal.<p>Single-alphabet substitution ciphers like the Caesar cipher are not at all secure, and they can be very easily broken — since <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack target=_blank>brute forcing</a> all possible keys takes a trivial amount of time. It can alternatively also be broken by trying to <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis#Frequency_analysis_for_simple_substitution_ciphers target=_blank>match the frequency distribution</a> of letters of the ciphertext and the frequency distribution of letters of a language.<details open><summary>Brute force attacks</summary> A brute force attack refers to systematically trying all possible combinations of a secret key or password, until the correct one is found.</details><h2 id=One-Time_Pad>One-Time Pad</h2><p>In the Caesar cipher all the letters are shifted by the same amount, determined by a single-valued key.

And hence the name.<p>To understand why reusing keys is dangerous, consider two different messages that are encrypted with the same key. Attackers can subtract the ciphertext of one message from the other to leak data about the plaintext.

Addition and subtraction in modulo two arithmetic is the <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GF(2)#Properties target=_blank>same</a>, so like ROT13, the same operation can be used for encryption and decryption:<p><code>c = (m + k) mod 2</code><br> <code>m = (c + k) mod 2</code></p><svg viewbox="0 0 200 75" fill=none height=450px id=bitarraySVG width=1200px><desc>Bit array.</desc><rect fill=#aaa height=150 id=bitarrayBG width=200 x=0 y=0 /></svg><p>Modulo two addition is implemented in hardware using <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate target=_blank>XOR gates</a>.

It should be at least as long as the plaintext stream, and should be truly random. And again, the key should never be reused, as otherwise it can leak information about the plaintext:</p><svg viewbox="0 0 200 75" fill=none height=450px id=bitarraySVG width=1200px><desc>Bit array.</desc><rect fill=#aaa height=150 id=bitarrayBG width=200 x=0 y=0 /></svg><details open><summary>XOR self inverse</summary> In XOR, a number is its own inverse.

If a key (which is at least the size of the message) can be securely transmitted, it makes more sense to simply send the message itself instead.<p>A simpler approach for exchanging keys is for the communicating parties to have a sort of a random number generator that somehow generates the <strong>same</strong> random keystream for both parties. Such random number generators <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator target=_blank>do exist</a>. Most of them generate numbers that <em>appear</em> random from an initial value called the seed. For the same seed value, the same stream of random numbers is generated.<p>Communicating parties can then encrypt and decrypt messages by securely the seed values, and then encrypt and decrypt data using the random keystream generated by the random number generator.</p><svg viewbox="0 0 200 75" fill=none height=450px id=bitarraySVG width=1200px><desc>Bit array.</desc><rect fill=#aaa height=150 id=bitarrayBG width=200 x=0 y=0 /></svg><p>However, there are caveats to this. Since the keystream is completely determined by the seed, it is not truly random and thefore not perfectly secure. But while it is not <em>perfectly</em> secure, it is still <em>reasonably</em> secure — as long as an attacker cannot easily recreate the original keystream.<p>One way to generate such pseudorandom keystreams is using ARX (add-rotate-XOR) operations on a seed value. The <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20#ChaCha_variant target=_blank>ChaCha20</a> cipher is an example of an <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher#ARX_(add%E2%80%93rotate%E2%80%93XOR) target=_blank>ARX cipher</a> that uses a 512-bit value as its seed.<h3 id=ARX_Operations>ARX Operations</h3><p>ChaCha20 generates a pseudorandom keystream from a 512-bit block by first dividing it into a 4x4 block of 32-bit <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(computer_architecture) target=_blank>words</a>.</p><svg viewbox="0 0 200 75" fill=none height=450px id=bitarraySVG width=1200px><desc>Bit array.</desc><rect fill=#aaa height=150 id=bitarrayBG width=200 x=0 y=0 /></svg><p>A pseudorandom block is generated from this block by performing addition, rotation and XOR operations on the words. The ARX operations can be grouped into rounds, and each round can be divided into four quarter rounds. A quarter round operates on four words at a time, and is defined as:<p><code>a += b; d ^= a; d <<<= 16;</code><br> <code>c += d; b ^= c; b <<<= 12;</code><br> <code>a += b; d ^= a; d <<<=  8;</code><br> <code>c += d; b ^= c; b <<<=  7;</code><p>These operations effectively ‘mix’ or <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://cr.yp.to/snuffle/diffusion.html target=_blank>diffuse</a> the bits of the four words with each other:</p><svg viewbox="0 0 200 75" fill=none height=450px id=bitarraySVG width=1200px><desc>Bit array.</desc><rect fill=#aaa height=150 id=bitarrayBG width=200 x=0 y=0 /></svg><p>Performing the quarter rounds four times makes up one full round. On odd rounds, the quarter round is performed on all four columns of the matrix, while on even rounds, the quarter rounds is performed on the four left diagonals of the matrix.

The blocks must not repeat and must be different from each other for them to be considered secure — or else an attacker can use the same techniques used to break the Vigenère cipher to break ChaCha20.<p>Producing more blocks which are different from the generated block using the same ARX operations on the same seed block is however, impossible. Since the ARX operations are deterministic, the same seed block always produces the same pseudorandom block. The only way to generate different blocks is to alter the operations, or alter the seed block.<p>Having a standard way to alter the initial state block is much cleaner than having altering operations for each block. Altering the initial state block can involve simply changing just a few bits — due to the cascading effects of diffusion, even a single bit flip results in a completely different pseudorandom block.</p><svg viewbox="0 0 200 75" fill=none height=450px id=bitarraySVG width=1200px><desc>Bit array.</desc><rect fill=#aaa height=150 id=bitarrayBG width=200 x=0 y=0 /></svg><p>In ChaCha20, the last four words (128 bits) are reserved in the original 512-bit block for the sole purpose of generating new blocks.

So the counter values must never repeat, and must always be incrementing. But this is not ideal. If any part of some message needs to be encrypted (or decrypted) again, it would require finding its corresponding counter value. The counter value is not just its position in the message — it would also need to take into account the the ordinal value of the message itself.<p>A cleaner approach to prevent repeating blocks, is by using a nonce. A nonce is simply a number used once. Whenever a new message needs to be encrypted a new and unique nonce is generated. This ensures the entire initial state block is always unique even if the counter values are not. And, since counters can repeat, they can then be used to truly represent positional information.</p><svg viewbox="0 0 200 75" fill=none height=450px id=bitarraySVG width=1200px><desc>Bit array.</desc><rect fill=#aaa height=150 id=bitarrayBG width=200 x=0 y=0 /></svg><p>The nonce is also two words (64 bits).

Diffusing bits that are all zeroes with each other does not generate a pseudorandom block but simply produces an all-zero block.

Or more specifically, the <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance target=_blank>number of bit flips</a> due to changes the inital state should form a <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution target=_blank>binomial distribution</a> centered around half the bit length of the output block.</p><svg viewbox="0 0 200 75" fill=none height=450px id=bitarraySVG width=1200px><desc>Bit array.</desc><rect fill=#aaa height=150 id=bitarrayBG width=200 x=0 y=0 /></svg><p>Empirical evidence suggests, it is the case. ChaCha20 produces output blocks that look uniformly random. Evaluating the randomess analytically is much more difficult however, because the interaction between the bits of the block quickly grows complex with each round. While there are ways to <a href="https://webdoc.sub.gwdg.de/ebook/dissts/Bochum/Daum2005.pdf#page=57" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>measure the avalanche effect</a> — small changes flipping roughly half the bits, there is no proof that ChaCha20 blocks blocks can be distinguished (or not) from truly uniform random bitstreams.<p>There are however other ways to test its security — for example, using <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_cryptanalysis target=_blank>linear</a>, <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_cryptanalysis target=_blank>differential</a> or <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_cryptanalysis target=_blank>rotational</a> <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis target=_blank>cryptanlysis</a>. ChaCha with six rounds has been <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://cr.yp.to/streamciphers/attacks.html#chacha6 target=_blank>broken</a>, but there have been no successful attacks on twenty rounds of ChaCha.<p>ChaCha20-Poly1305, therefore is generally <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www.cryptrec.go.jp/exreport/cryptrec-ex-2601-2016.pdf target=_blank>considered secure</a>.<hr><h2 id=References>References</h2><ul><li>Daniel J.
