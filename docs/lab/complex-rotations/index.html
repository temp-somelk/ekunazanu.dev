But then it becomes a challenge on how to place those numbers on the number line. This is where it helps to make certain assumptions.<ul><li><strong>Assumption I</strong>: Since the square root of negative numbers could not be mapped on the real number line, they must lie on a completely different number line. Since these numbers do not lie on the real number line, they will also be referred to as imaginary numbers from now on.</ul><svg viewbox="0 0 200 75" fill=none height=450px id=bitarraySVG width=1200px><desc>Bit array.</desc><rect fill=#aaa height=150 id=bitarrayBG width=200 x=0 y=0 /></svg><ul><li><strong>Assumption II</strong>: The square root of any negative numbers (imaginary numbers) can derived using the square root of negative one and scaling it with a <strong>real number</strong>. Square root of negative one shall be denoted as <code>i</code>. So an imaginary number can be represented as <code>b·i</code>, where <code>b</code> is a real number. The real and imaginary numbers together shall be described as a sum <code>a+bi</code>, where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are real numbers and <code>i</code> is the square root of negative one.</ul><svg viewbox="0 0 200 75" fill=none height=450px id=bitarraySVG width=1200px><desc>Bit array.</desc><rect fill=#aaa height=150 id=bitarrayBG width=200 x=0 y=0 /></svg><ul><li><strong>Assumption III</strong>: Addition is defined as <code>(a+bi) + (c+di)</code> = <code>(a+c) + (b+d)i</code>; ie. both operate on their own respective real and imaginary components. Multiplication is defined as <code>(a+bi) · (c+di)</code> = <code>a·c + a·i + bi·c + bi·di</code> or simplified, <code>(ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i</code> — ie. multiplication is distruted over addition.</ul><p>It can be inferred from the assumptions:<ul><li>Addition affects their own component and has no effect on the other entity.<li>Since any imaginary number can be thought of as root of negative one scaled up by a real number, <strong>multiplying a real with any imaginary number results in a (scaled) imaginary number</strong> as well — ie. <code>k · bi</code> = <code>kb·i</code>.<li>Multiplying an imaginary number with an imaginary number can be thought of as multiplying their scalars and multiplying their roots of negative one. Squaring the root of negative one is negative one, thus <strong>multiplying two imaginary numbers results in a (scaled) negative real number</strong>. That is, <code>bi · di</code> can be rewritten as <code>b·d · i·i</code> = <code>bd · -1</code> = <code>-bd</code>.<li>Multiplying two numbers with both non-zero real and imaginary components results in a number that is the product of the two numbers following the rules of distributive multiplication over addition.</ul><p>It is difficult to visualize how multiplication of numbers with non-zero real and imaginary components transforms the number lines. But addition and multiplication with either only a real component or an imaginary component is relatively easier to vizualize. Geometerically:<ul><li>Addition with real numbers shifts the real number line.<li>Addition with imaginary numbers shifts the imaginary number line.<li>Multiplication with real numbers stretches the real number line as well as the imaginary number lines.<li>Multiplication with imaginary numbers morphs number lines such that: <ul><li>If the number (line) was on the real number line, it now lies on the imaginary number line.<li>If the number (line) was on the imaginary number line, it now lies on the flipped real number line.</ul></ul><svg viewbox="0 0 200 75" fill=none height=450px id=bitarraySVG width=1200px><desc>Bit array.</desc><rect fill=#aaa height=150 id=bitarrayBG width=200 x=0 y=0 /></svg><p>These assumptions, constraints and the resulting visual transforms might seem arbitrary at first, but the motivation behind it starts making sense when we expand into the second dimension.<h2 id=Complex_Plane>Complex Plane</h2><p>Take any point on a cartesian plane, and keep track of its coordinates as well as the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> axes when it is rotated counter-clockwise by 90°:</p><svg viewbox="0 0 200 75" fill=none height=450px id=bitarraySVG width=1200px><desc>Bit array.</desc><rect fill=#aaa height=150 id=bitarrayBG width=200 x=0 y=0 /></svg><p>The <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> axes get swapped, and the <code>x</code> axis also gets flipped.

And that begs the question — is it any useful if it can only represent quarter turn rotations? Or can it be generalised for other angles too?<h3 id=A_Different_Angle>A Different Angle</h3><p>Multiplying a number by <code>i</code> rotates it by a quarter turn, and multiplying a number twice by <code>i</code> would rotate it by half a turn. But multiplying twice by <code>i</code> is the same as multiplying by negative one — since <code>i·i</code> is just <code>-1</code>.

Does <code>√i</code> need to be defined as another new number — that results in a 45° rotation? Before defining new numbers, it’s useful to see if <code>√i</code> can be defined using the existing number system. Finding <code>√i</code> is much easier analytically — compared to deducing it from its geometric properties.<p><code>Let a+bi = √i</code><br> <code>=> (a+bi)^2 = i</code><br> <code>=> a^2 - b^2 + 2abi = i</code><br> <code>=> a^2 − b^2 = 0, 2ab = 1</code><br> <code>=> a = 1/√2, b = 1/√2</code><br> <code>=> √i = 1/√2 + i/√2</code>\<details><summary>Alternate solutions</summary> The above equation also has another solution: <code>a = -1/√2,  b = -1/√2</code>. However for simplicity’s sake it has been excluded for now.</details><p>Analytically, <code>√i</code> is equivalent to <code>1/√2 + i/√2</code>, and multiplying a number by <code>1/√2 + i/√2</code> rotates it by 45° — somehow the analytically derived value of <code>√i</code> is consistent with its geometric properties which was only <em>assumed</em> to be true.</p><svg viewbox="0 0 200 75" fill=none height=450px id=bitarraySVG width=1200px><desc>Bit array.</desc><rect fill=#aaa height=150 id=bitarrayBG width=200 x=0 y=0 /></svg><p>The number <code>1/√2 + i/√2</code> interestingly lies halfway between <code>1</code> and <code>i</code>. It also lies on unit circle, forming a 45° angle with the positive real number axis. Other points lying on the unit circle such as <code>1/2 + √3i/2</code> and <code>√3/2 + i/2</code> form 30° and 60° angles with the positive real axis, respectively — and multiplying a point with the mentioned numbers again rotates it by 30° and 60° accordingly.<p>In fact multplying a number by another number that lies on the unit circle rotates it — by the angle formed by the number on the unit circle and the positive real axis:</p><svg viewbox="0 0 200 75" fill=none height=450px id=bitarraySVG width=1200px><desc>Bit array.</desc><rect fill=#aaa height=150 id=bitarrayBG width=200 x=0 y=0 /></svg><p>If a number is multiplied by another number that is not on the unit circle, it again gets rotated by the angle formed by the multiplier and positive real axis.

But to be formally used in mathematical context, it is necessary to establish certain formal definitions to describe ‘rotation’ and ‘stretching’ — and to prove it holds true for all points in the plane.<p>Specific terms can be defined to help describe the properties of the new plane and the number system — which will aid in formally describing and quantifying the rotational and stretching effect of multiplication:<ul><li>Numbers of the form <code>a+bi</code> where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are real numbers, and <code>i</code> is <code>√-1</code> are defined as <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number target=_blank><strong>complex numbers</strong></a> — and the plane formed by the perpendicular real and imaginary number lines is defined as the <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane target=_blank><strong>complex plane</strong></a>.<li>The <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_(complex_analysis) target=_blank><strong>argument</strong></a> of a complex number is defined as the angle between the line joining the origin and the complex number, and the positive real axis.

The absolute value of a complex number <code>z</code> is denoted by <code>|z|</code>.</ul><p>While having formal defintions to work with is helpful, it is mostly useless if it is used to describe the properties of an idea whose underlying assumption about the premise itself is flawed, or based only on experimental observation of a few numbers — instead of a solid logical proof that applies <em>generally</em> to all numbers.<p>So there needs to be a proof that shows multiplication rotates and stretches the entire complex plane. Or more formally, it needs to be proved that the argument of the product of two complex numbers is the sum of the argument of the individual numbers, while the magnitude of the product is the product of the magnitude of its individual numbers.</p><svg viewbox="0 0 200 75" fill=none height=450px id=bitarraySVG width=1200px><desc>Bit array.</desc><rect fill=#aaa height=150 id=bitarrayBG width=200 x=0 y=0 /></svg><h2 id=Explanation>Explanation</h2><p>Before going through a proof, it first helps to understand how multiplication has the effect of rotating numbers — by decomposing how the real and imaginary components of the product change with respect to its operands.<p>The product of two complex numbers <code>a+bi</code> and <code>c+di</code> is <code>ac-bd + (ad+bc)i</code>. The real component of the product is <code>ac-bd</code> and the imaginary component is <code>ad+bc</code>. For the real component, <code>ac</code> signifies that the real components of the product scales with the magnitude of the real components of its factors.<p>However, it also gets subtracted by <code>bd</code> — the product of the imaginary components. One way to visualise it is if the imaginary components increase, their arguments increase as well, shrinking the projection of the product on the real number line.</p><svg viewbox="0 0 200 75" fill=none height=450px id=bitarraySVG width=1200px><desc>Bit array.</desc><rect fill=#aaa height=150 id=bitarrayBG width=200 x=0 y=0 /></svg><p>The imaginary component of the product is <code>ad+bc</code>. To keep things simpler, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> are kept constant. Then, <code>a</code> can be viewed as determining the magnitude of the first number, while <code>d</code> as the argument of the other number — suggesting that the magnitude of the first number gets rougly ‘rotated’ by the argument of the second number when multiplied. As either of the magnitude or argument gets bigger, the product’s projection on the imaginary axis gets bigger.<p>A similar argument can be made for <code>bc</code>, keeping <code>ad</code> constant — the magnitude of the second number gets rotated by the argument of the first number.</p><svg viewbox="0 0 200 75" fill=none height=450px id=bitarraySVG width=1200px><desc>Bit array.</desc><rect fill=#aaa height=150 id=bitarrayBG width=200 x=0 y=0 /></svg><p>These are only useful to build an initial intuition, and are in no way complete, and are not at all exact.<h3 id=Trigonometric_Proof>Trigonometric Proof</h3><p>To be more rigorous, some knowledge about trigonometry is required.

The new transformation also preserves its old behaviour of stretching the real number line, except it now stretches the entire complex plane itself. It expands the scope of the multiplication function rather than altering it in a way that breaks its previous behaviour.<p>Similarly, the assumption about the existence of an imaginary line that is perpendicular to the real number line does not break any existing convention. In fact, when combined with the new defintion of multiplication, it can elegantly describe two dimensional rotations.<p>So now the question arises: Does it warrant redefining multiplication, and creating a new number system for describing rotations? Absolutely. Does it make sense that a number system that is intuitive, and is used to <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function target=_blank>describe reality</a> are called imaginary? Absolutely not. Would you describe negative numbers as ‘unnatural’ because they are not a part of natural numbers?</article></main><footer><a href=https://ekunazanu.dev/more#terms-of-use>© 2024</a> <a href=https://ekunazanu.dev>Anchit Roy</a> · <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ target=_blank>CC BY 4.0</a></footer>
