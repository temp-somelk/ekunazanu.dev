I am Anchit. I am a third year computer science undergraduate student. I like math, movies, progressive rock, and coding. One of them is a lie.<p><img alt="doodle of frustrated person looking at their computer" decoding=async loading=lazy src=/media/others/doodle-frustrated-looking-at-computer.avif><p>I also like doodling I guess.<h2>About</h2><p>Most smart people I know have their own blogs and I want to <em>appear</em> smart too, so here we are. Alright no, my real goal is to be able to become competent enough to write high-quality-production-grade-hyper-fast-efficient-code™ within the next two years. The only hurdle between me and my path to mediocre success is my laziness and stupidity. And a semi-practical to be self aware of my laziness and stupidity, is by trying to keep a <a href=/log>log</a> of my laziness and stupidity. So here we are.<p>Just kidding; the <em>real</em> real goal was indeed the first one: Trick people into thinking I’m smart.<p><img alt="doodle of person saying “haha fooled ya”" decoding=async loading=lazy src=/media/others/doodle-jebaited.avif><p>There’s also another section <a href=/lab>lab</a>, where I’ll post ‘actual’ content. It simply means that I’ll try to put at least <em>some</em> effort towards the content. Maybe. These will mostly be topics that I find interesting — boring things like math and data.<p>Anyway, here’s <a href=/more>more</a> things about the site if you care to know. Here’s the <a href=/atom.xml>site feed</a>.<h2 id=-1>Contact</h2><p>If you want to complain about my lousy writing, point out factual inaccuracies, or send ideas or memes to me, you can reach me at <a href=mailto:foo@ekunazanu.dev>foo@ekunazanu.dev</a>.
